# Alarms

To ensure visibility on the health of the overall service, we have set up CloudWatch alarms to notify developers via email.

These alarms are triggered when certain thresholds are crossed on the following services:

- [Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/)
- [Simple Queueing Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/)
- [Kinesis](https://aws.amazon.com/kinesis/)
- [API Gateway](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/welcome.html)
- [Network Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/network/load-balancer-cloudwatch-metrics.html)

The notifications are sent to a SNS topic.

[SNS subscription](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_Subscribe.html) recipients are managed in [AWS SSM Parameter Store](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html), and can be found under the name:

```
/codebuild/pttp-ci-infrastructure-core-pipeline/$ENV/critical_notification_recipients
```

The monitored [metrics](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/aws-services-cloudwatch-metrics.html) and thresholds are documented below:
